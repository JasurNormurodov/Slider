Frontend developer test task from Pixel-Point 

This section contains a slider that has an autoplay option and a progress circle. The right side should have fade-in effect on slide change. The right side is just images. It's infinite slider so after we play the latest item in the list, we move back to the first. The slider itself should be implemented without using extra libraries. No need to design responsive versions. 

We can click anytime to any item from the left list and autoplay should continue from that step.
